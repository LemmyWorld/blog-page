This is a basic Lemmy.World blog post. It is our own lorem ipsum, with no superior quality. It just is, and it’s familiar. It’s familiar, because we just made it so, declared by pure badassery. Because it’s familiar, it’s enjoyable to experience. It’s a train of thought, an enjoyment of the words and the flow, maybe a placeholder maybe not, it’s been 5 months since Antik had pot. We deny, we accept, we read, but we may ignore; maybe a lot. No offense, we might be childish, maybe not.

There was once a Belgian man known for a well shaven head, shining extraordinarily well before the sight of light on any ordinary night. Beside him was mighty Ruud, who looked at the Belgian man in confusion, but thought repeatedly screaming “Fuck you Jesse!” was a solution.

The cactus lophophora williamsii is known for is psychedelic effects, and is perfectly awesome (and easy to access) to try and get high on. Trust me, or not, you’ll see some shit. The country I did this in, is, of course, not disclosed, which could have been any from a list of many. :wink:

At Lemmy.World, we really value users a lot. Like, a lot. What you say and complain about actually matters?! How come? We’re volunteers. We’re volunteers. We’re volunteers. And we still do everything we can. And we love you, and expect it back. Is that too much to ask? Come on, heh heh heh.

I joined the website 5 months ago, because it looked like something new and exciting. I built most of the community building culture here, and I’m glad to see it all working out awesomely. I’m also glad to see my dear friend (nerdy ass) working his way through all the difficulties and having a badass team to keep us afloat. And I dearly love to see my newbie Dutch friends and the quiet oldie enjoying their presence when they are present in our team environment.

I had a donation-run library once. It was in a far away country of course, to wherever you are, guaranteed. In it I had 7552 books sent as donations from all over the country, and it was all always open at all times, without record keeping. We also offered free tea to anyone that came and wanted to sit to discuss the books they’ve read from us. Always a joy to see old people, seemingly ignorant, effortlessly schooling the younglings in any discussion relying on consistent judgement. The discussion table rules, and it schools, and it stays ignorant of Dada.

I love trees. Do you love trees? What if I told you, trees could elevate you?
